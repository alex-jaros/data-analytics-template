# Results Folder

## Overview
The `results/` folder contains all outputs generated from the analysis in the project. These outputs may include tables, figures, and summaries of findings.

## Folder Purpose
This folder serves as the centralized location for storing processed results that are ready for interpretation or presentation. Keeping all results in one place ensures an organized workflow and easy access for review or sharing.

## Contents
- **Figures**: Visualizations such as plots, graphs, and charts generated during the analysis.
- **Tables**: Summarized data in table format, often used in reports or publications.
- **Reports**: Finalized findings or documents summarizing the key takeaways from the project.

## Guidelines for Adding Results
1. **File Naming**:
   - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `eda_visualization.png`, `model_results.csv`).
   - Include a version or date in the filename if applicable (e.g., `summary_table_v1.csv`).

2. **File Formats**:
   - Save figures as `.png` or `.jpg`.
   - Save tables as `.csv` or `.xlsx`.
   - Save reports as `.pdf` or `.docx`.

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - When adding new files to the folder, briefly describe them in this `README.md` file under the **Contents** section.

## Example Files
- `scatter_plot_age_vs_income.png`: A scatter plot showing the relationship between age and income.
- `regression_summary_table.csv`: A CSV file containing the coefficients and metrics of the regression model.
- `final_report.pdf`: A PDF report summarizing the analysis and key findings.

## Notes
- This folder should only contain finalized outputs. Work-in-progress files should be stored in a separate directory if needed.
- Ensure all files are clearly labeled and relevant to the project.
